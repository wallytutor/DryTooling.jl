# DryTooling.Kramers

Implements the ordinary differential equation for prediction of bed
height profile in a rotary kiln as proposed by Kramers and Croockewite
(1952) [^1]. Its goal is to be used as a process support tool or to
integrate more complex models requiring integration of the bed profile.
