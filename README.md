# DryTooling

I am often faced with using the same approach for different engineering and scientific problems, but I don't like repeating the same task again and again. This is where `DryTooling.jl` comes in. By adopting some principles of [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) in Julia, to a larger extent than its definition, it packages together models and workflows that are not available or validated elsewhere -- and in some cases adapts existing models. The tools will progressively cover a broad range of numerical applications and data treatment, this package is in its early days from the migration of my old Python scripts and packages.

Also [dry tooling](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-tooling) is my favorite sport!
